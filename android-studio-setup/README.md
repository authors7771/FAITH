# Android Studio & Rooted AVD Setup Guide (Ubuntu 22.04)

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up Android Studio and rooted AVD (Android Virtual Device) environments on Ubuntu 22.04. It includes image installation, QEMU build information, and rooting instructions using the `rootAVD` project.

---

## âœ… 1. Install Android Studio

### Requirements

* **OS**: 64-bit Ubuntu 22.04
* **CPU**: Intel VT-x or AMD-V support
* **RAM**: 8GB minimum (16GB+ recommended)
* **Disk**: 8GB free space minimum
* **Dependencies**: `openjdk-11-jdk`, `snapd`

### Installation

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk snapd
sudo snap install android-studio --classic
```

Launch Android Studio and complete SDK and AVD setup as needed.

---

## âœ… 2. Download and Configure AVD Images

### Supported Images

* **Android 11 (API 30)**: x86, x86\_64, arm64-v8a
* **Android 15 (API 34)**: x86\_64, arm64-v8a

### Setup Instructions

1. Open AVD Manager in Android Studio
2. Create AVD with desired image and architecture
3. Verify that the emulator boots and operates correctly

---

## âœ… 3. QEMU Update (If Needed)

Some architectures like `arm64` may require a custom QEMU build.

### Example QEMU Build

```bash
mkdir emu
cd emu
repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest -b emu-master-dev --depth=1
repo sync -qcj 24
cd external/qemu
pip install absl-py urlfetch
python3 android/build/python/cmake.py --noqtwebengine --noshowprefixforinfo --target linux_aarch64
```

---

## âœ… 4. Root AVD using rootAVD

The [rootAVD](https://github.com/newbit1/rootAVD) tool allows rooting Android AVDs easily.

### Clone & Execute

```bash
git clone https://github.com/newbit1/rootAVD.git
cd rootAVD
```

### Root Your AVD

1. Launch your target AVD using Android Studio
2. Run the following to list available AVDs:

```bash
./rootAVD.sh ListAllAVDs
```

3. Choose your image and follow the commands on the shell.

---

## âœ… 5. Root Certificate Injection

To insert a custom root certificate:

### Android 11 (API 30)

Use the [Always Trust User Certs](https://github.com/NVISOsecurity/AlwaysTrustUserCerts) to inject your root certificate into the system trust store.

### Android 15 (API 34)

Use the following approach:

1. Push the certificate file (e.g., `12ac77fc.0`) and script (e.g., `system_cert_injection.sh`) to your AVD:

```bash
adb push 12ac77fc.0 /data/local/tmp/
adb push system_cert_injection.sh /data/local/tmp/
```

2. Make the script executable:

```bash
adb shell chmod +x /data/local/tmp/system_cert_injection.sh
```

3. Execute the script from AVD shell:

```bash
adb shell /data/local/tmp/system_cert_injection.sh
```

This will mount the modified CA store using tmpfs and bind it into both `/system/etc/security/cacerts/` and `/apex/com.android.conscrypt/cacerts/`, making the root certificate trusted system-wide.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

* **Avoid Emulator & VirtualBox Conflicts**: Simultaneous use may cause VT-x conflicts.
* **Certificate Injection**: Use rooted AVDs to test apps with custom root certificates.
* **Android Emulator (not physical device)**: When testing in this setup, `dnsmasq` is not needed as `/etc/hosts` resolution suffices.

You're now ready to develop and test Android apps with root-level access and advanced configurations!
